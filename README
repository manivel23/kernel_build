DEFAULT behavior:
    - Kernel source is downloaded and built in directory where this script is
    - Will automatically download and build the LATEST kernel
    - Will automatically upgrade kernel config when moving to next major version
        For new config entries:
            - Anything that can become a module will be modularized
            - Everything else gets the DEFAULT value
    - DEBS will be built in a sub-directory named 'debs' under the directory
        where this script is
    - The 'debs' directory will be deleted and re-created if it exists
    - Will use config.kernel in the directory where this script is
    - Defaults to using as many threads as available cores
    - config.prefs in directory where this script is can contain name=value
        pairs that will be applied to the config while building

Things that can be changed using environment variables:
    KERNEL_TYPE:  Will filter available kernels
        IGNORED if it is not a recognized type:
            latest|mainline|stable|longterm

    KERNEL_VERSION:  Will override version from config file
        Will filter available kernels

    KERNEL_CONFIG: FULL PATH to existing config file
        Will override config.kernel in this directory

    KERNEL_BUILD_DIR: Overrides current_dir/debs
        - All path components except the last one MUST exist
        - If last path ocmponent does not exist, it is created
        - If last path component exists, all files/dirs under that
            path are DELETED

    NUM_THREADS: Number of threads to use

    KERNEL_CONFIG_PREFS: FULL path to file containing name=value pairs
        that wukk be applied to the config while building


config.prefs or KERNEL_CONFIG_PREFS format:
    - Lines starting with '#' are ignored
    - Blank lines are ignored
    - Valid lines should contain:
        name=value OR
        name = value
    - Regex is '^\s*(?P<KEY>\S+)\s*=\s*(?P<VAL>\S+)'

Packages required:
    Run required_pkgs.sh in this directory to check and report missing
    packages

    patch_and_build_kernel.sh automatically calls this when it runs
